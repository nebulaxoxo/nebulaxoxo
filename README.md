Aspiring developer kinda, sort of, maybe, obsessed with all things space and tech.
Hi.

I work on Python mainly, and am currently doing courses on JAVA and C++ (at my own pace). 
This is my private space. A lot of rough drafts and sketchy codes may be found (dont sue me if you find a virus). More than 80% of them will be WIPs, so ignore them. Ignore the final works too, they're mine.

Alright, bye now.
